# Praise Folder

i do this thing where i can buy something or get something and just tuck it away, ready to be enjoyed, in a corner of my mind and life.

i knew i would love wong kar-wai for like 3 years before i did.

ill buy a coke and put it in the fridge and totally out of mind, and be totally blessed and surprised when i find it.

past me becomes a lovely benevolent force in my life, heâ€™s kept some of the very best things from me and is constantly giving them back as gifts.

**i think i lost all of them, i never actually looked at them anyway, i just liked knowing it was there**

the praise folder is a great example of this, it was real and on my desktop but it was more this mind-folder in a mind-PC.

its been a great way to have some of the truly beautiful things said to me by truly beautiful people constantly bubbling to the surface, i feel like have prayers are being made for me.

thanks to all of you guys :D
