# Chise
Saikano, or The Last Love Song on this little Planet

![[saikanomeme.png]]
*a meme that I made with the intention of sending to space. Its text references Saikano (aka The Last Love Song on This Little Planet), a show whose main character Chise I reference heavily. The elements of the meme (a 981.jp landscape, urbit's "Angel wings' ' and a snow Scene from Frame Gride, a box blurred image of Yukari.) reference the angelic extinction duty of Chise and the cold setting of the show. The meme has also been bent into shape to provide a backdrop and a surface like the auction sellers often do*

Chise is an amazing character i think about a lot. Her role in the show (Saikano isnt even good outside of Chise) is that she is in Love and also that she is a weapon of mass destruction that she must use to defend her nation from attack. She's a great example of this tragic hopefulness i love in characters, She has to keep Fighting to save what she loves. I feel like her sometimes

*Another honest depiction of Otaku's workspace. I imagine this is a cheap laminate desk with its contents pushed to the side to get one last photo of the precious Chise figure before it is sold. The Chise figure that was central to the image is also one of the few items I can verify the current whereabouts of, as I brought it and its sitting just below my monitor.*

*Chise Chain, One of the best depictions of Chise ive found in auctions. Chise I love for her standout design amongst a generic cast, as well as her Angelic and Exitinctionist role in the series, a Girl who ascended into a Weapon.*

*Saikano was also very special to me because me and Mara Barl just both parallel decided to watch it at the same time. without communicaiton, a little timeline sync back in the day of explosive posting*

*There was also a Brief period where I made an alt and named it Chise. i posted to see if i could make the same friends again, got added to the chat as the alt, played the role for a while. I then revealed the trick and absorbed the friendships even stronger*
