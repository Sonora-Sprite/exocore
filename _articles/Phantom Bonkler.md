Its been a Year since Bonkler and Bonkler Will Run One a Day for a Year after this. Bonkler was put together as a practice in finding meaning a form in a shape made of other things, a form clothed entirely in curation and citiation.

"Bonkler" as a concept then becomes the midpoint of 365 bonklers, a bonkler simply being an example of a archetype, this is true for many works made with Generational software
