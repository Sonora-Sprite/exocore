# Phantom Bonkler
![[Bonkler 1.png]]*Bonkler with the New Phantom Armor asset, Head of Flame, Skeleton Face, Phone Charm Flail, It'll All Be Over Background, Cased Figure Body and One Day At A Time Coin Shield.*

Its been a Year since Bonkler and Bonkler Will Run One a Day for a Year after this. Bonkler was put together as a practice in finding meaning a form in a shape made of other things, a form clothed entirely in curation and citation. The popular tech of Image Generation used in NFTs at the time is a natural fit for this, it naturally allows you to "roll the dice" on the a series of assets and find not just new combinations but a wealth of similar images. "Bonkler" as a concept then becomes the midpoint of 365 bonklers, a bonkler simply being an example of a archetype, this is true for many works made with Generational software.

 The thing is, this True Bonkler or this archetype doesn't exist especially pre-release, nevertheless its still become a aesthetic profile thats recognizable to people both internal to Remilia and externally to dedicated fans. A Phantom Limb that is almost entirely functional. It's a Phantom occupying space in my personal aesthetic structures. Still even in this form, the idea of something Being like a Bonkler, or like a Bonkler asset has been helpful to me as a way to see new things and to more freely appropriate them in turn.  
 Bonkler is The Hero of [[Auction Core Thread|Auction Core]] .
 I made a project with this lens that essentially ended up being the "Bonkler of found photography", and its made me wonder if the framework could be extended, if I could make the Bonkler of Clothing labels, the Bonkler of film and so on and so forth.
