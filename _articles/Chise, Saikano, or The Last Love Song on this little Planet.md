# Chise, Saikano, or The Last Love Song on this little Planet

![[The Last Little Love Story on This Little Planet (Milady Sonora).png]]
*a meme that I made with the intention of sending to space. Its text references Saikano (aka The Last Love Song on This Little Planet), a show whose main character Chise I reference heavily. The elements of the meme (a 981.jp landscape, urbit's "Angel wings' ' and a snow Scene from Frame Gride, a box blurred image of Yukari.) reference the angelic extinction duty of Chise and the cold setting of the show. The meme has also been bent into shape to provide a backdrop and a surface like the auction sellers often do*

Chise is an amazing character i think about a lot. Her role in the show (Saikano isnt even good outside of Chise) is that she is in Love and also that she is a weapon of mass destruction that she must use to defend her nation from attack. She's a great example of this tragic hopefulness i love in characters, She has to keep Fighting to save what she loves. I feel like her sometimes
