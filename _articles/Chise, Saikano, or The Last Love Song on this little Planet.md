# Chise, Saikano, or The Last Love Song on this little Planet

![[The Last Little Love Story on This Little Planet (Milady Sonora).png]]
*a meme that I made with the intention of sending to space. Its text references Saikano (aka The Last Love Song on This Little Planet), a show whose main character Chise I reference heavily. The elements of the meme (a 981.jp landscape, urbit's "Angel wings' ' and a snow Scene from Frame Gride, a box blurred image of Yukari.) reference the angelic extinction duty of Chise and the cold setting of the show. The meme has also been bent into shape to provide a backdrop and a surface like the auction sellers often do*

Chise is an amazing character i think about a lot. Her role in the show (Saikano isnt even good outside of Chise) is that she is in Love and also that she is a weapon of mass destruction that she must use to defend her nation from attack. She's a great example of this tragic hopefulness i love in characters, She has to keep Fighting to save what she loves. I feel like her sometimes

*Another honest depiction of Otaku's workspace. I imagine this is a cheap laminate desk with its contents pushed to the side to get one last photo of the precious Chise figure before it is sold. The Chise figure that was central to the image is also one of the few items I can verify the current whereabouts of, as I brought it and its sitting just below my monitor.*
