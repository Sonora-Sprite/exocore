Learning to use Exocore is doing something to me, working as an artist especially on dealing in lighter tone, its interesting to try put words in place for why i love these things so much. Its harder to praise and hope in words to yourself.

I think I to daily or at least frequently write short notes about images from auctioncore or that have been included in works that have become important to me.
